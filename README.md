# Learning Go with Test-Driven Development
This is my personal repository for learning Go using Test-Driven Development (TDD), inspired by [this website](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests).

## What's Inside
Each folder in this repo corresponds to a chapter or concept from the guide. It contains the Go code and tests I wrote while working through the material.

### Notes
This repo is just for my learning, but feel free to explore if you're interested.
